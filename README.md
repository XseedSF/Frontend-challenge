## üß†  Context

In this link you'll find the figma with the designs you'll have to follow:

https://www.figma.com/file/dNuO6I2hDGcwoKFA4bjGGh/Challenge?node-id=0%3A1

The challenge is to develop the 3 screens using Star War's public API (https://swapi.dev/)

------------
## üíª Technologies

 * React js
 * Redux
 * Axios 

------------
## üì± Screens

1.  ### **Menu**

      You'll need to create a basic hamburger menu, we recommend you to use React Router for the routing.

      The default route should be Characters

2.  ### **Characters**
      In this screen you'll need to render a list with the characters returned  on the /people endpoint showing:
       * Name on first line
       * Gender | birth date
       * Planet (you'll have to make a request to the homeworld returned on the /people endpoint)   
       * A heart icon that will allow the user to add or remove the character as a favorite (save this in Redux)
3.  ### **Favorites**
      * Add a search input to search through saved users in Redux, if there's no search you'll show all the favorites characters.
      * Render a list with the favorites characters saved in Redux, the user needs to be able to remove a character there.
